# Qiskit Device Benchmarking Notebooks

This folder contains example notebooks for running benchmarks.

- [Layer Fidelity](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-device-benchmarking/blob/main/notebooks/layer_fidelity.ipynb): Example notebook for running the layer fidelity using the generation code in qiskit-experiments. In this particular example the code uses the qiskit reported errors to guess the best chain of qubits for running the layer fidelity. However, it can be easily adjusted to run on an arbitrary chain.
